This app looks at data from the NYPD Traffic Violations data set available on NYC Open Data (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us). The app analyzes data from July 2012 through July 2018.

The data is stored in a SQLite database and queried by the app using features selected by the user. The user can look at all data or focus on collisions involving injuries, death, cyclists or pedestrians. The data is filtered by borough and can be viewed as annual or monthly over the whole time line. The user can further focus on a particular time range within the day.

The app shows line graphs of the type of collisions per day selected by the user over the time range selected for every year in the data set. It also includes infor boxes showing the maximum, minimum, mean and variance of the data selected.

I have a map also in the code to show the locations of collisions within the time line and borough selected by the user that is not usable at this time. It works well on its own, but does not integrate into the larger app. I am hoping to fix this in future updates.

The app is accessible through the link at the top of this readme file.
